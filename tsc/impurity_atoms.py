"""
The impurity_atoms.py file holds functions that generate the required parameters for the problem's impurity atoms.
The two main functions [1] create a single basis atom or [2] create a chain of magnetic impurities in a spin-helix
configuration. Additional functions can be added to create different types of configurations, which may not be as universal.
